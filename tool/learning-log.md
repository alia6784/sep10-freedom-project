Tool:A frame

AFrame is a web framework for building virtual reality (VR) experiences. A-Frame is based on top of HTML, making it simple to get started. But A-Frame is not just a 3D scene graph or a markup language; the core is a powerful entity-component framework that provides a declarative, extensible, and composable structure to three.js.

A-Frame aims for highly immersive and interactive VR content with native-like performance. For this, A-Frame believes the minimum viable bar will trend towards positionally-tracking headsets with positionally-tracked controllers. This is the paradigm in which A-Frame wants to innovate as well as discover new grounds that are specific to the VR Web (e.g., link traversal, decentralization, identity). Contrast this type of content against flat and static 360° content and menus.

At the same time, A-Frame wants everyone to be able to get involved with VR content creation. A-Frame supports all major headsets with their controllers. Fortunately with the large community and contributors, A-Frame is able to both look far towards the future as well as satisfy the needs of today’s VR landscape.

# What is WebXR?
WebXR is a JavaScript API for creating immersive 3D, virtual reality (and augmented reality) experiences in your browser. Or simply put, allows VR in the browser over the Web.

A-Frame uses the WebXR API to gain access to VR headset sensor data (position, orientation) to transform the camera and to render content directly to VR headsets. Note that WebXR, which provides data, should not be confused nor conflated with WebGL, which provides graphics and rendering.

The 
Hardware

When it comes to the hardware that we use.
Specifically, we use cameras, lenses, flashes, tripods, computers, hard drives, etc.
However, we use our camera equipment and computer hardware as extensions of our bodies.
And I think of our bodies as hardware also.
Additionally, when it comes to our bodies, we use our eyes, hands, legs, brain, etc.
Also, just as we need to maintain and take care of our camera equipment, we need to maintain and take care of our bodies.
After all, if our bodies aren’t well then we more than likely won’t be up for making photographs.

I was just searching up software and hardware for photographers and videographers and just gathering information since blog 1.

## My topic

I decided on photography/videography because i always loved to take photes and videos growing up and now i am going to buy a camera and continue taking photes at a professional level.I want to find a new way to incorporate technology into this topic since it is based of technolgy
my backup choice were cars becuase the history of cars in tech has really changed scince the first car till now and every car has been getting more updated everyday like some cars like tesla can drive them sevles so it is good and interesting topic to research about.My soruces where mostly https://blog.mingthein.com/2017/05/23/the-design-process/, https://www.ednasia.com/engineering-a-digital-camera-system/, https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/72629 and ect.

## Skills


some skills that I have laerned researching about my topic is how to really reserch through websites because not all website give you real and dirict answers.A lot of webstie dont talk about the answers dirictly or give you the dircit answer you really need to read and dig deep.A lot of the websites that I read had maney pages of informaiton but I learned how to find the important information only so I can save time.

Another skill that I learned is how to google.This is a very important skill because Knowing how to use Google well is super helpful for many reasons. It helps you find information fast, solves problems, and supports your learning. You can stay updated on what's happening in the world, and it's great for schoolwork too. It makes you more productive and can even help you find jobs when you're older. Google is like your friendly guide to the internet, and it's a key tool for personal growth and success in today's digital world.


## EDP
Making photo cameras is like solving a big puzzle. First, engineers dream up the camera and what they want it to do, like taking beautiful pictures. Then, they plan how to put it all together, thinking about the lenses, buttons, and the inside parts. After that, they build a prototype, which is like a test version, and see if it works. If it doesn't, they fix it until it's just right. Finally, they make the real camera. It's kind of like building a super cool LEGO set but much more complicated. Engineers use their creativity and problem-solving skills to make sure the camera takes awesome photos that we can enjoy.

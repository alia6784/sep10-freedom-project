my backup chses were cars becuase the history of cars in tech has really changed scince the first car till now and every car has been getting more updated everyday like some cars like tesla can drive them sevles so it is good and interesting topic to research about.

some skills that i have laerned research about my topic is how to really reserch through website because not all website give you real and dirict answers.

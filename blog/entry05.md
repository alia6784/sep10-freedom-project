In this lesson I have learned about my tool which is A-frame , A-frame is a very fun and interesting because of all the 3D objects and animation you can make.AFrame is a web framework for building virtual reality (VR) experiences. A-Frame is based on top of HTML, making it simple to get started. But A-Frame is not just a 3D scene graph or a markup language; the core is a powerful entity-component framework that provides a declarative, extensible, and composable structure to three.js. I have tried moving around the 3D obejects and tinkering with it so I can see how I would apply it to my freedom project.

#### Takeaways from the expo elevator pitch

Some takeaways I got from the Expo elevator pitch was that I did not talk a lot and I wanted to talk more about my website but I feel like I got nervous and was not focusing when I was doing my elevator pitch.

#### Takeaways from  my in class presentation

I was very nervous and excited if that makes sense when i was doing my in class presentation I feel like i went up with confidence and energy and did my best but when i tired to show off my website the link did not work and i know what i did wrong and fixed it but it was too late to so next time i will practice  more to avoid any mistakes.

## context and MVP

during this project I learned a lot about photography when i was researching for my prohect and it helped make it.When i was making my MVP I had to start with finding a templete and making sure it was basic enough to fit my wireframes.Then i had to make sure that the navbar was the one I wanted and that would work with wireframes that i have.The timeline shown below is what i used to make this project and how i manged my time.

4/18 Make a navbar and starts adding images

4/19 start/finsh my formatting

4/20 add A-frame

4/21 do all my final touches

5/1 cheack everything and make sure i am done

## takeaways
some takeaways that I had was the code, I did not remember a lot of the code so i had to use w3schools and bootstrap to help me.I learend a interesting code that looks like cards and you can use images in it which made my website look more organized.
